# Bluesky

To embed a Bluesky post into your Quarto html document you can use the shortcode like this:

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
{{< bsky <POST_ID> >}}
```

Where `<POST_ID>` is the Bluesky post ID from the URL. For example:

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
{{< bsky 3lgyb5za7bc2b >}}
```

Which is rendered like this:

{{< bsky 3lgyb5za7bc2b >}}

You can obtain the post ID by inspecting Bluesky's URLs.

For instance, in this URL, `https://bsky.app/profile/sellorm.com/post/3lgyb5za7bc2b` the post ID is the part after the last '/' in the URL.
